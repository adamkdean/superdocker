# superdocker

Superdocker allows you to manage multiple docker hosts easily. This is not for clusters, this is for working with different environments.

For example, let's say you have three environments that you use:  
- local boot2docker install (`boot2docker`)
- single network docker host (`local`)
- remote swarm cluster (`remote`)

If you wanted to use your local docker client with each of these, you'd have to keep changing your environment variables or pass the host via `-H`. But you don't have to live this way, you can superdocker it.

## Install

Install via npm:

    npm i superdocker -g

## Upgrading

To upgrade all global packages, use this:

    npm outdated -g --depth=0.

## Create a config file

You'll need to create a config file in your home directory:

    touch .superdocker

In this, place your configuration:

    [boot2docker]
        DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/adam/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
        DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376

    [local]
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.1.100:2375

    [remote]
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://swarm.yourhost.com:2375


## Check it's working

You can now run `superdocker <configuration> <commands>`, which is the same as `docker <commands>`:

    $ superdocker boot2docker info

## Troubleshooting

Make sure your docker client version matches your docker server version, or you'll have a bad time.

    $ superdocker remote info
    FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: client and server don't have same version (client : 1.18, server: 1.14)
