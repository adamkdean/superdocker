# superdocker

Superdocker allows you to manage multiple docker hosts easily. This is not for clusters, this is for working with different environments.

For example, let's say you have three environments that you use:  
- local boot2docker install (`boot2docker`)
- single network docker host (`local`)
- remote swarm cluster (`remote`)

If you wanted to use your local docker client with each of these, you'd have to keep changing your environment variables or pass the host via `-H`. But you don't have to live this way, you can superdocker it.

## Install

Install via npm:

    npm i superdocker -g

## Create a config file

You'll need to create a config file in your home directory:

    touch .superdocker

In this, place your configuration:

    [boot2docker]
        DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/adam/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
        DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376

    [local]
        DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=0
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.10.13:2375

    [remote]
        DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=0
        DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.17.0.1:2375

## Check it's working

You can now run `superdocker <configuration> <commands>`, which is the same as `docker <commands>`:

    $ superdocker boot2docker info
